## Pricing

This page provides the details of the cost and licensing of each extension. 

You can use any extension for free in the Sandbox environment, which is a testing platform that simulates the production environment. However, if you want to use an extension in the production environment, you need to obtain a license from us. 

To get a license, please [contact us through the form on our website](https://www.fusion5.co.nz/contact-us/). We will get back to you with a quote and the steps to activate your license.
